# C++ Projects

A collection of C++ projects demonstrating core programming concepts, data structures, and problem-solving skills developed during my academic studies and self-learning.

## About

This repository contains various C++ implementations and exercises from **C++ Programming: From Problem Analysis to Program Design** by D.S. Malik ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Problem-Analysis-Program-Design/dp/1337102083)), with plans to add more academic projects as I locate and refactor them.

## Status

Currently on hold as I focus on backend development through a bootcamp. I plan to return in the future to complete the remaining textbook chapters and add additional academic work.

*This repository reflects my foundation in C++ and systems programming, complementing my current backend development focus.*
