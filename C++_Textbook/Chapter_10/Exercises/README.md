## Usage

1. Most of these programs are multi-file with a specification and classification file. I've already generated the object code file but if you wish to recompile the file use `g++ -c object_filename.cpp`.

2. Depending on the amount of multi-files you would need to use for the main program, you may need to add more arguments when compiling. To compile the program use `g++ main.cpp object_filename1.o object_filename2.o ... -o main`. Afterwards, you can run the program using `.\main`.

> **Note**: The usage of `g++` is the compiler I use for my C++ files, you can replace `g++` with any other compiler you use for C++ programs.
> I also use `-o main` as a preference to run the code but you can change the executable to whatever you want.
